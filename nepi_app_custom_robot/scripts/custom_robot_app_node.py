# NEPI APP CUSTOM_ROBOT -- NODE
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# apps_mgr launches this file with a plain rosrun, using the pkg_name/app_file/
# node_name from params/custom_robot_app_params.yaml. The node then:
#   1. init_node() and create a MsgIF for logging.
#   2. Build a NodeClassIF from four plain dicts (configs, params, pubs, subs).
#      NodeClassIF creates every ROS interface and the standard
#      save_config / reset_config / factory_reset_config topics.
#   3. Mount a ControlsIF holding everything an operator adjusts from the RUI.
#   4. Construct the three device connects (camera, motor, NPX), one
#      selector row each in the RUI, plus a hidden NavPose connect that
#      follows the NPX selection.
#   5. initCb(), start the work and status timers, spin().
#   6. The work timer keeps the NavPose connect on the selected NPX's navpose
#      topic and builds the one RBX device (scripts/custom_robot_rbx_if.py)
#      once the selected motor device connects. The IDX connect does not feed
#      the RBX; it only drives the RUI image viewer.
#
# This node never touches rospy. rospy lives only in nepi_sdk/nepi_ros.py; use
# the nepi_sdk wrappers (init_node, start_timer_process, on_shutdown, spin).
#
# CONTROLS CONTRACT (src/nepi_apps/CONTROLS_MIGRATION_PATTERN.md is the
# authority; nepi_app_file_pub_img is the worked example):
#   Anything an operator ADJUSTS from the RUI is a control. Anything read once
#   at startup, written by the NODE, or owned by a sub-interface is not.
#     * value an operator types or drags -> CONTROLS_INIT_DICT
#     * command carrying a compound value or a traversal verb (goto_location,
#       select_folder, home_folder) -> stays a topic; a Button control calls
#       the SAME private method, never a second implementation
#     * node-written state that merely persists (current_folder, running)
#       -> stays in PARAMS_DICT
#   PARAMS_DICT does NOT have to end up empty. The test is not "does this
#   value persist" but "does the operator type it".
#   What must never survive: a control AND a param both writing one piece of
#   state.
#
# THREE TRAPS WORTH KNOWING BEFORE YOU EDIT THE CONTROL SET
#   * controls_updated_callback is called with TWO arguments,
#     (control_name, update_value) -- see nepi_api/system_if.py. A one-argument
#     callback raises TypeError on every update.
#   * 'Discrete' is NOT a control type. nepi_controls.CONTROL_TYPES is
#     Menu, Button, Buttons, Toggle, Toggles, String, Selection, Selections,
#     Int, Ints, IntSlider, Float, Floats, FloatSlider, RangeSlider, ColorRGB.
#     create_controls_dict() wraps each entry in a bare except, so a bad type
#     is silently dropped and the widget never appears. checkControlsInitDict()
#     below turns that into a named warning.
#   * Prefer Selection over Menu whenever the stored value is meaningful text.
#     A Menu value is the INDEX into its option list, and that index silently
#     re-points at a different entry as soon as the list is rebuilt.
#
# ControlsIF is given NO node_if, so it builds and owns its own NodeClassIF.
# Sharing this node's would merge both registries -- register_pubs/register_subs
# /add_params do a keyed dict.update() -- and a generic key ('status_pub',
# 'reset', 'enable') would silently orphan a sibling's publisher: the topic
# stays advertised and never publishes again, with nothing in the log
# (2026-07 DECISION LOG in the workspace CLAUDE.md). The same applies to every
# other sub-interface you mount here (NavPoseIF, ColorImageIF, SettingsIF):
# leave node_if unset.
#
# TODO: run setup_new_app.sh, then replace the example control set, the status
# msg fields and the work in updaterCb with your own.
